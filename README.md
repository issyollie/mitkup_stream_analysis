Goal: Start points
1)	Find the start point of each stream (inception) with relevant attributes 
a.	Presence of fish downstream (?)
b.	Elevation (from the line segment or for the point derived from lidar) 
c.	Trib_count
2)	Find the prevailing slope of area, gradient, biome, elevation 
Suitability Analysis
3)	Acquire trail map 
4)	Merge with roads layer for an accessible layer 
5)	Buffer analysis with all points within X distance 
a.	Filter by “accessibility” – define max slope, max elevation, etc. 
6)	Second option is a multi-criteria evaluation 
a.	Parameter 1: Distance from trail or road (Accessibility) 
b.	Parameter 2: Slope under a certain amount
